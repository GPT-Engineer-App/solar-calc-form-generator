# solar-calc-form-generator

Create a modern landing page for lead generation, our landing page needs a solar cell calculator/form where the user enters the address & zip code, a map where we draw out where we want to put solar cells, if we want to change the air source heat pump and water heater. When the customer clicks next, we get a summary like this "Summary
